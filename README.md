# ðŸ“Œ Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe  

## ðŸ“– Description  
A more complex version of classic Tic-Tac-Toe, where each small board influences the mega board.
Built using React for an interactive and dynamic experience.
Features a modular component-based structure for easy expansion and updates.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play  
The game consists of 9 smaller Tic-Tac-Toe boards inside a mega board.  
The first move can be placed anywhere.  
The next move is restricted to the small board corresponding to the position of the previous move.  
Winning a small board claims it for the player in the mega board.  
The first player to win three small boards in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
